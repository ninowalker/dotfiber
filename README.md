# .Fiber

*(pronounced: dot fiber)*

A toolchain for scaling local development setup and process in large polyglot, Microservice, and evolving organizations.

## Why

Development toolchains which were once standard and tightly integrated with our fat and bloated IDEs, have not kept up with the complexities of setting up environments that are efficient across polyglot services. Local Web development used to be single service bound to localhost. No longer.

Onboarding new users and maintaining environments while allowing developer flexibility and fine-grained control is a huge management problem.


### It's not about your fancy tools

Our tools are evolving rapidly and specializing by tier. Webpack, parcel, sbt or maven: developers should not care, except for the initial decision. After that, it's just mechanics of a process.

*.Fiber* focuses on the process; providing an transparent abstraction over the tools, that doesn't handcuff you to the radiator blindfolded.

### It's about the process and flexibility.

* Minimal dependencies
* Semantic errors and error correction
* Repository agnostic


## .Fiber

* Configuration as code
* Easy to use (noob-friendly!)
* DevOps
